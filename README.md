## Nginx Rate Limiter

This repo contains code to an article I am writing on how to setup Nginx as a rate limiter. Link to the article would be added below once it is complete.

### Requirements

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.
- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) is a web server that can be used as a HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server, Load balancer and HTTP cache.

## How to Setup

- Ensure you have node, docker and docker compose installed.
